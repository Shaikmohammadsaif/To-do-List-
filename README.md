# To-do-List-
To-Do List Application
Description:
Developed a command-line To-Do List Application using Python to help users manage their tasks efficiently. The application allows users to add, view, mark as complete, and delete tasks. Tasks are stored in a plain text file (tasks.txt), ensuring data persistence even after the program is closed. This project demonstrates strong skills in Python programming, file handling, and structured software design.

Key Features:
Add Task:

Users can add a new task with a description and an optional due date.

View Tasks:

Displays all tasks with their status (Pending or Completed) and due dates.

Mark Task as Complete:

Users can mark a task as completed by selecting its number.

Delete Task:

Users can delete a task by selecting its number.

Persistent Storage:

Tasks are saved to a file (tasks.txt) in a simple text format, ensuring data persistence.

Technologies Used:
Python: Core programming language.

File Handling: For saving and loading tasks to/from a plain text file.

Command-Line Interface (CLI): Lightweight and easy-to-use interface.
